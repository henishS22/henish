Hi Arpit/Rajat,

Hope you are doing well.

Recently my Mom is having a low fever and is not feeling well. So in order to help her and continue my work I would like to Work from Home for next 5 days.

It would be really helpful if you provide the required permission for the same.

Thanks and Regards,

Respected HR,

Hope you are doing well.

As you are aware that recently we all received our salary, sadly I found that there is some mismatch in my salary calculation and because of that I have received less amount than actual amount.

I have attached my this month and last month's salary calculation. I hope you will look into the matter and resolve this.

Thanks and Regards,
