SUB: [IMPORTANT] Request for Work from Home for next 5 days

BODY:
Hi Arpit/Rajat,

Hope you are doing well.

Recently my Mom is having a low fever and is not feeling well. So in order to help her and continue my work I would like to Work from Home for next 5 days.

It would be really helpful if you provide the required permission for the same.

Thanks and Regards,
Dharmaraj Jadeja
